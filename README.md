## Projects

In this project, I worked with a group to classify poor credit scores with the use of Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. We compare baseline models with k-fold cross validation models, and models that undergo feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and oversampling techniques (SMOTE, BSMOTE, ADASYN).

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).
