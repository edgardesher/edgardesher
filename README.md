In this project, I worked with a group to classify poor credit scores with the use of Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. We compare baseline models with k-fold cross validation models, and models that undergo feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and oversampling techniques (SMOTE, BSMOTE, ADASYN).

The objective of this project is to generate association rules in the Family Income and Expenditure Survey for the Year 2012. I worked with a group to find that households in the "Poor" income class as a consequent are the combination of low expenditures, male household heads, and rural residence.

This project was done to create a visualization for the Family Income and Expenditure Survey for the Year 2021. We use Plotly to create various iterations of visualizations, using Gestalt Design Principles and Interactivity Measures as guides to create the project,
